# phase-0-gps-1

The commands we used are the following:
git clone 
	- We used that to remote into the repository and be able to have a local repository cloned  
git add 
	- Was used to stage the changes (in this case the repository we want to work with)
git commit
	- Was used to take the tracked changes (stages) and actually submit them with a descriptive message logging what changes were made. This will then create a 'save-point'
git status
	- This was used to check frequently what the terminal had reported when we made our inputs
git push origin master
	- We used this to push our local committed changes to the GitHub website (the remote repository)

The commands that are used after we got the repository:
git checkout
	- This was how we accessed branches
git checkout -b add-command-log
	- This was used to initialize a new branch to work with and access from that point
git branch
	- This was how we observed which branch we were working with. This helps to see all the branches
